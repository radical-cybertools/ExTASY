This directory contains the needed force field and parameter 
files to run PYP using the setup from Professor Bolhuis's group.

They were kind enough to share their gromacs setup with us.

There is a bash script, MDRun.sh that runs grompp and mdrun.
All the files have their default names.

There are also the results of a very short test run performed with
these input files.

I ran this test run with gromacs 4.6.2. 

Just for reference, I made a .gro file of the resulting trajectory in traj.gro,
using the command:

trjconv -f traj.xtc -o test.gro -center -s topol.tpr -ur compact -pbc mol -n index.ndx

Do please let me know if something looks wrong or doesn't work, or doesn't work with
whatever version of groamcs you are using.
