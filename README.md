# ExTASY 0.2
============

ExTASY 0.2 is a tool to build and run multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations 
which can be coupled to an Analysis stage. This forms a simulation-analysis loop 
which can be made to iterate multiple times. It uses EnsembleMD Toolkit, which
provides the individual building blocks to create each of the simulation and 
analysis stages and to execute the workflow in heterogeneous machines.
